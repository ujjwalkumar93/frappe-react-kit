# 📦 Frappe React Kit (WIP)

> ⚠️ **This project is a work in progress. Not yet published to npm.**

**Frappe React Kit** is a modern, open-source React SDK (currently under development) designed to simplify integration with [Frappe](https://frappeframework.com) backend applications. It provides developers with a clean, type-safe, and customizable experience for building powerful UI frontends using **React**, **Chakra UI**, and **Frappe**.

This kit is still in **active development**. APIs and components may change as we stabilize the design system, authentication model, and component patterns.

Stay tuned for an official release on npm.
